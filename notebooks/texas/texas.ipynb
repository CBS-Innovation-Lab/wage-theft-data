    "We shared the results of our analysis with the Texas Workforce Commission so they could comment. After receiving no response for about two weeks, Brian New, our local reporter in Texas interviewed the director of the Commission. In that interview, the director told Brian that they gave us the wrong fields for several of the fields we requested. This notebook will document how we're handling this in our analysis. There are also additional notes in notebooks/national_analysis/national_analysis.ipynb. "
