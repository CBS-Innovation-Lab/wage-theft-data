## FAQs

### What is "wage theft?"

Wage theft refers to the illegal practice of an employer not paying their employees the full amount of wages that they are owed. This can take many forms, such as not paying overtime, not paying the minimum wage, or making illegal deductions from an employee's pay.

###  How did you get this data?

CBS News requested the data through a public records request under the New Hampshire Right to Know Law. The agency provided data exported from its case management system. The data was cleaned and analyzed by CBS News.

### How can I trust this data? 

This data was thoroughly cleaned and vetted prior to being analyzed. The data was provided by the New Hampshire Department of Labor, which is the agency responsible for enforcing the state's wage and hour laws. CBS News then undertook a thorough review of the data to ensure that it was accurate and complete. Wherever possible, any errors or inconsistencies were identified and addressed, and cases that were clearly incomplete, inaccurate, or otherwise not relevant were removed from the dataset.

### How does my state compare to others? 

It is difficult to make direct comparisons between states because each state has different laws and enforcement mechanisms, and because the quality of states' case management systems can vary wildly. For example, some states track detailed data on each case, including status dates and detailed disposition data, while others only track the amount claimed and the date the case was filed. This means that data on wages and labor conditions in one state may not be directly comparable to data from another state.
