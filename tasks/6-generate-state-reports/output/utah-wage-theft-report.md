## Data Summary

Through a public records request under the Utah Government Records Access and Management Act, CBS News sought more than 10 years of data from the Utah Labor Commission's wage and hour complaint process. In response, the agency provided approximately 10,103 records going back to May 2001.

The median amount for each case was $622.10. Here's how losing that amount could impact an average worker in utah

$622.10 is the equivalent of: 
* 0 weeks of pay for the average worker in utah.
* 1 months of rent for the average renter in utah or 0 months of mortgage payments for the average homeowner in utah.
* 3 weeks of groceries for the average family in utah.

Some cases were worth even more money, however. Below is a breakdown of the number of cases filed in each amount range:

## FAQs

### What is "wage theft?"

Wage theft refers to the illegal practice of an employer not paying their employees the full amount of wages that they are owed. This can take many forms, such as not paying overtime, not paying the minimum wage, or making illegal deductions from an employee's pay.

###  How did you get this data?

CBS News requested the data through a public records request under the Utah Government Records Access and Management Act. The agency provided data exported from its case management system. The data was cleaned and analyzed by CBS News.

### How can I trust this data? 

This data was thoroughly cleaned and vetted prior to being analyzed. The data was provided by the Utah Labor Commission, which is the agency responsible for enforcing the state's wage and hour laws. CBS News then undertook a thorough review of the data to ensure that it was accurate and complete. Wherever possible, any errors or inconsistencies were identified and addressed, and cases that were clearly incomplete, inaccurate, or otherwise not relevant were removed from the dataset.

### How does my state compare to others? 

It is difficult to make direct comparisons between states because each state has different laws and enforcement mechanisms, and because the quality of states' case management systems can vary wildly. For example, some states track detailed data on each case, including status dates and detailed disposition data, while others only track the amount claimed and the date the case was filed. This means that data on wages and labor conditions in one state may not be directly comparable to data from another state.
