# New York data notes

The "wage claim" category in the original data can apparently contain any kind of wage claim, including unpaid wages, minimum wage, tips, etc. 

They also have categories for each of the above so unclear why this is the case. 

I am keeping it as unpaid_wages because of this, but it should be noted that the categories are not entirely accurate for this state. 

In addition, the "farm" category apparently includes all kinds of investigations. Because it could include non wage related records, those will be dropped. It should be noted that this could exclude some wage theft related cases.
