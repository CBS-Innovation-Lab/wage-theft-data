# Kansas data notes

The "Notes" field of the data provided contains some indications of how the case was disposed. However, it is not complete. Therefore, I will use it to label records whose notes field clearly denote the disposition of the case, and will leave blank any notes fields that are merely flags for something that happened at some stage of the case.
