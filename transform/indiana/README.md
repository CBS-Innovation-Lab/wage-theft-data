# Indiana data notes

I received this response from their FOIA person: 

> Accepted- We received and accepted the claim.<br>
> Draft- Claimant left at draft did not submit claim<br>
> Duplicate- Duplicate- Submitted twice<br>
> Exceeds- Exceeds claim limit<br>
> Missing information- insufficient information<br>
> Ref- Referred to OAG<br>
> Rescinded- Claimant Cancelled<br>
> New- new case submitted<br>

But these do not appear to indicate the final outcome of the case. For example, there are many cases which have paid amounts but also have the status "Accepted" or "Info requested" which appear to indicate pending cases. Those statuses are converted to null.
